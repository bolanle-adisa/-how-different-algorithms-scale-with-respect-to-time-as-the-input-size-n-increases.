Use ‘n’ random integer inputs in the algorithms and plot your results. 
Plot your results for ‘n’ using a step size of 1000. 
Begin ’n’ at 0 and ends it at 1000000000. Note: Use a static array to make C++ handle large arrays.  
1.    Show your C++ code to produce your results here. 
2.    Show your plot with the time on the ‘y’ axis and the inputs ‘n’ on the ‘x’ axis. 
3.    Compare your results from the algorithms and submit your findings on them. 
4.    Explain the best case and worst case time complexity for each of the algorithms.     
The algorithms you will be using are:  
Linear Search  
Binary Search  
Jump Search  
Interpolation Search
